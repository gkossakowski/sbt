# Test for class-based invalidation of dependencies
# by inheritance. The source file A.scala defines
# A and A2 classes. The B.scala inherits from A2 but
# in the test api of A is modified. B.scala shouldn't
# get invalidated if invalidation happens at
# class level
# this test case covers https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/2320

# introduces first compile iteration
> compile
$ copy-file changes/A1.scala src/main/scala/A.scala
# second iteration
#> compile
# check if there are only two compile iterations performed
> check-compilations
